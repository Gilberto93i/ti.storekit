# Ti.Storekit Module

## Description

The Storekit module allows you access to Apple's in-app purchasing mechanisms.

## How Do I Get Started?

## Getting Started

View the [Using Titanium Modules](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules) document for instructions on getting
started with using this module in your application.

## Accessing the Storekit Module

To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:

	var Storekit = require('ti.storekit');

## Testing a Store

<strong>Note: </strong>Store Kit does not operate in iOS Simulator. When running your application in iOS Simulator,
Store Kit logs a warning if your application attempts to retrieve the payment queue. Testing the store must be done on actual devices.

## Breaking changes in version 3.0.0

Added support for Apple's new receipt structure available in iOS 7.0 and later. To `validateReceipt`:  

1. Obtain the Apple Inc. root certificate from [http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/](http://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/)
2. Download the Apple Inc. Root Certificate ( [http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer](http://www.apple.com/appleca/AppleIncRootCertificate.cer) )
3. Add the AppleIncRootCertificate.cer to your app's `Resources` folder.

Arguments are now passed to the `purchase` function in a dictionary instead of individually.

### Warning
This module uses open source code for parsing and validating the receipt. It is recommended by Apple that users not use common code to do this as it will make it easier to crack your app. Please make appropriate changes to the receipt verification code in the module to make your implementation unique and less vulnerable to attack. We cannot do this for you or offer recommendations regarding how it should be done for obvious reasons.

## Breaking Changes in version 2.0.0

It was previously possible for a transaction to complete after the application had been moved to the background due to the app store
needing to obtain information from the user. Although your application may have received a _FAILED_ notification when your application
was moved to the background, your application would not have received a _PURCHASED_ notification if the user completed the transaction from
the app store. In order to support this situation, purchase notifications are now sent to your application as an event rather than through
a callback.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this module (prior to version 2.0.0) you should be
aware of the following breaking changes to the API:

* The _purchase_ function no longer returns a Ti.Storekit.Payment object.
* The _callback_ parameter has been removed from the _purchase_ function. You must now register an event listener 
for the _transactionState_ event to receive notification of FAILED and PURCHASED transaction events.
* The _payment_ property is no longer returned as part of the transaction complete notification.

## Deprecated since version 1.6.0

The _verifyReceipt_ function has been updated to better support receipt verification with Apple. As a result, the following
changes have been made to the _verifyReceipt_ function:

* Setting the callback in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Pass the callback as the 2nd parameter to _verifyReceipt_.
* Setting the sandbox property in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Use the 'receiptVerificationSandbox' property for the module.
* Setting the sharedSecret property in the argument dictionary has been DEPRECATED. Use the 'receiptVerificationSharedSecret' property for the module.

## Functions

### requestProducts(ids[array], callback(e){})

Requests to see if products identified by the strings in the _id_ array are available.
The _callback_ function is called upon completion of the request, with the following event
information:

* success[boolean]: Whether or not the request succeeded
* message[string]: If the request failed, the reason why
* products[array]: An array of _[Ti.Storekit.Product][]_ objects which represent the valid products retrieved
* invalid[array]: An array of identifiers passed to the request that did not correspond to a product ID. Only present when at least one requested product is invalid.

Returns a _[Ti.Storekit.ProductRequest][]_ object.

### purchase(args[object])

Purchases the _[Ti.Storekit.Product][]_ object passed to it.  The _transactionState_ event is fired when
the purchase request's state changes.

Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:

* product[_[Ti.Storekit.Product][]_]: The product to be purchased.
* quantity[number] (optional): The quantity to be purchased. Has a default value of 1.
* applicationUsername[string] (optional): An opaque identifier for the userâ€™s account on your system. Used by Apple to detect irregular activity. Should hash the username before setting. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.

### verifyReceipt(args[object], callback(e){})

**Deprecated:** Use `validateReceipt` in iOS 7.0 and later.

Verifies that a receipt passed from a Storekit purchase or restored transaction is valid. Note that you rarely need to do this
step in-app. It is much more likely that you would want to do this step on your own server to confirm from Apple that a
purchase is legitimate.

<strong>Important</strong> There is a vulnerability in iOS 5.1 and earlier related to receipt validation. Your application
should perform the additional step of verifying that the receipt you received from Store Kit came from Apple. This is
particularly important when your application relies on a separate server to provide subscriptions, services, or downloadable
content. Verifying receipts on your server ensures that requests from your application are valid.

Takes one argument, a dictionary with the following values:

* identifier[string]: The transaction identifier
* receipt[blob]: A receipt retrieved from a call to Ti.Storekit.purchase's callback evt.receipt.
* quantity[int]: The number of items purchased
* productIdentifier[string]: The product's identifier in the in-app store

The _callback_ function is called when the verification request completes, with the following event information:

* success[boolean]: Whether or not the request succeeded
* valid[boolean]: Whether or not the receipt is valid
* message[string]: If _success_ or _valid_ is false, the error message
* identifier[string]: The transaction identifier
* receipt[object]: A blob of type "text/json" which contains the receipt information for the purchase.
* quantity[int]: The number of items purchased
* productIdentifier[string]: The product's identifier in the in-app store.

Returns a _[Ti.Storekit.ReceiptRequest][]_ object.

### validateReceipt()

Checks if the receipt on the device is valid. Returns true if the receipt is valid or false if it is not. Throws an error if the receipt does not exist, use `receiptExists` to avoid this error.

Returns a boolean.

**Note:** Available in iOS 7.0 and later.

### refreshReceipt(args[object], callback(e){})

Allows an app to refresh its receipt. With this API, the app can request a new receipt if the receipt is invalid or missing. In the sandbox environment, you can request a receipt with any combination of properties to test the state transitions related to Volume Purchase Plan receipts.

The args object can contain the following properties:

* expired[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt is expired.
* revoked[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt has been revoked.
* vpp[number]: A number interpreted as a Boolean value, indicating whether the receipt is is a Volume Purchase Plan receipt.

The _callback_ function is called when the refresh request completes, with the following event information:

* success[boolean]: Boolean indicating if the request was successful or not.
* error[string]: Error message if success is false.

For more information checkout Apple's [SKReceiptRefreshRequest Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StoreKit/Reference/SKReceiptRefreshRequest_ClassRef/SKReceiptRefreshRequest.html)

**Note:** Available in iOS 7.0 and later.

### restoreCompletedTransactions()

Asks the payment queue to restore previously completed purchases. The _restoredCompletedTransactions_ event is fired when
the transactions have been restored. 

Note that calling this may ask the user to authenticate!
It is recommended that you give the user the option to restore their past purchases via a button, and invoke this method
only after the user touches it.

## Properties

**Note:** Available in iOS 7.0 and later.

### bundleIdentifier[string]

The bundleIdentifier of the app, used when validating the receipt. It is more secure to set it in the code than to read it out of the bundle. Required when calling `validateReceipt`.
